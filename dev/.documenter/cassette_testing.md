# Recorded HTTP tests with BrokenRecord {#Recorded-HTTP-tests-with-BrokenRecord}

This tutorial walks through writing a deterministic test for an endpoint in `PetstoreV2.jl` using [BrokenRecord.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTesting/BrokenRecord.jl).

The package&#39;s test scaffold already includes `test/test-cassettes.jl`, which configures BrokenRecord and creates `test/cassettes/`. This page fills in the steps you take from there.

## Why cassettes {#Why-cassettes}

Tests that hit real HTTP services are slow and flaky — your CI fails when the upstream is down, when rate limits kick in, or when the network hiccups. BrokenRecord records the response of an HTTP call to disk on the first run, then replays it from disk on every subsequent run. The test becomes a pure function of the cassette file — fast, deterministic, and offline.

The mode is decided purely by **whether the cassette file exists**:

|     Cassette file |                                               What `playback` does |
| -----------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Doesn&#39;t exist |        Real HTTP call. Request and response are saved to the file. |
|            Exists | Replays the recorded response. Verifies the request shape matches. |


To re-record, delete the cassette file and run the test again.

## 1. Install BrokenRecord {#1.-Install-BrokenRecord}

It&#39;s an opt-in dep — the test scaffold doesn&#39;t require it by default because most users want to wire cassettes only for a few endpoints.

```julia
pkg> activate test
(test) pkg> add BrokenRecord@0.1
```


## 2. Construct a `Client` and an API set {#2.-Construct-a-Client-and-an-API-set}

The generated low-level API ships in `src/api/`. Each tag becomes a struct (`PetApi`, `StoreApi`, …) that takes an `OpenAPI.Clients.Client` — accessible as `client.inner` on the hand-written wrapper:

```julia
using PetstoreV2

client  = Client("https://api.example.com"; auth = NoAuth())
pet_api = PetApi(client.inner)
```


That&#39;s the only generated-vs-hand-written boundary you have to know about; everything else stays on `Client`.

## 3. Write the first cassette test {#3.-Write-the-first-cassette-test}

In `test/test-cassettes.jl`, replace the commented example block with real `@testset`s. Each test wraps its endpoint call in `BrokenRecord.playback`:

```julia
@testset "GET /pet/{petId} — id 1" begin
    pet, _http = BrokenRecord.playback("get_pet_1.yml") do
        get_pet_by_id(pet_api, 1)
    end
    @test pet isa Pet
    @test pet.id == 1
end
```


Two things to know:
- Generated operation names are **snake_case**: spec `getPetById` → `get_pet_by_id`, `findPetsByStatus` → `find_pets_by_status`.
  
- Each operation returns `(parsed_result, http_response)`. Almost always you destructure the response and ignore the second value: `pet, _ = get_pet_by_id(pet_api, 1)`.
  

## 4. Record the cassette {#4.-Record-the-cassette}

The first run is the only one that needs network access:

```bash
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
```


You should see `test/cassettes/get_pet_1.yml` appear (default extension is `.yml`; pass `extension="bson"` to `BrokenRecord.configure!` if you want compact binary). Open the file — it&#39;s the recorded HTTP exchange with the headers listed in `ignore_headers` already redacted.

Commit the cassette:

```bash
git add test/cassettes/get_pet_1.yml
git commit -m "test: cassette for GET /pet/{petId}"
```


## 5. Replay everywhere else {#5.-Replay-everywhere-else}

From now on every `Pkg.test()` replays from disk. CI doesn&#39;t need the upstream API to be reachable, doesn&#39;t need credentials, and runs in milliseconds:

```bash
JULIA_NO_NETWORK=1 julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'   # still passes
```


## 6. Tests with auth {#6.-Tests-with-auth}

Cassettes redact credential-bearing headers via the `ignore_headers` option already configured in `test-cassettes.jl` (`Authorization`, `X-API-Key`, `Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, `Proxy-Authorization`). Token query params (`api_key`, `token`, `access_token`) are scrubbed via `ignore_query`. So tests like the following are safe to commit:

```julia
@testset "POST /pet" begin
    authed     = Client("https://api.example.com"; auth = BearerToken("secret"))
    authed_pet = PetApi(authed.inner)

    new_pet = Pet(; name = "doggie", photoUrls = ["https://example.com/dog.jpg"])
    saved, _ = BrokenRecord.playback("add_pet.yml") do
        add_pet(authed_pet, new_pet)
    end
    @test saved.name == "doggie"
end
```


The `"secret"` token is in the request _while recording_, but the recorded cassette only contains `Authorization: [redacted]`.

If your API uses a non-standard auth header or a token in the query string, extend the redaction list in `test-cassettes.jl`:

```julia
BrokenRecord.configure!(;
    path = _CASSETTES_DIR,
    ignore_headers = [..., "X-Custom-Auth"],
    ignore_query   = [..., "session_id"],
)
```


## 7. Re-recording {#7.-Re-recording}

When the upstream API changes shape — new fields, removed fields, schema bump — your replay tests will fail because the recorded response no longer matches what the parser expects.

To re-record one cassette:

```bash
rm test/cassettes/get_pet_1.yml
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'   # records, then replays
git diff test/cassettes/get_pet_1.yml          # review the change
git add test/cassettes/get_pet_1.yml
```


To re-record everything (after a major upstream version bump):

```bash
rm -rf test/cassettes/
mkdir   test/cassettes/
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
```


## Patterns that pay off {#Patterns-that-pay-off}
- **One cassette per endpoint, not per assertion.** Many `@test`s can live inside a single `playback` block. That keeps cassette count manageable and makes the recorded interaction easier to review.
  
- **Use minimal request bodies.** A short request makes a short cassette, which makes the eventual diff comprehensible.
  
- **Don&#39;t record `429`s.** Rate-limit handling belongs in mocked tests (`test-mocking.jl`) where you control the response with `Mocking.jl`. Reserve cassettes for the happy path and one or two semantic 4xx responses (404, 400) you actually want to assert against.
  
- **Inspect the YAML before committing.** Confirm the redaction did its job — search for any leftover token, header value, or query param.
  

## End-to-end worked example {#End-to-end-worked-example}

The transcript below is the actual output from running this tutorial against the **Petstore v2 demo** (the reference scaffold shipped by [OpenAPITemplate.jl](https://github.com/OpenAPITemplate/OpenAPITemplate.jl)). It exercises four endpoints — `/store/inventory`, `/pet/findByStatus`, `/store/order`, and `/pet` — and demonstrates the three-mode cycle (record → replay → re-record). Use it as a sanity check that your own setup matches.

### 1. Install BrokenRecord {#1.-Install-BrokenRecord-2}

```text
$ julia --project=test -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(name="BrokenRecord", version="0.1")'
   Installed BrokenRecord ─ v0.1.10
  [bdd55f5b] + BrokenRecord v0.1.10
```


### 4. First run — records 4 cassettes {#4.-First-run-—-records-4-cassettes}

```text
$ ls test/cassettes/      # before
(empty)
$ julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
Test Summary:       | Pass  Total  Time
Cassettes           |   10     10  13.4s
     Testing PetstoreV2 tests passed
$ ls test/cassettes/      # after
add_pet.yml  find_pets_available.yml  place_order.yml  store_inventory.yml
```


### 5. Replay run — fully offline {#5.-Replay-run-—-fully-offline}

```text
$ JULIA_NO_NETWORK=1 julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
Test Summary:       | Pass  Total  Time
Cassettes           |   10     10  14.3s
     Testing PetstoreV2 tests passed
```


### 6. Verify auth redaction {#6.-Verify-auth-redaction}

```text
$ grep 'special-key' test/cassettes/add_pet.yml
(no match — secret was stripped)

$ grep -E '^      - (api_key|Authorization|X-API-Key)' test/cassettes/add_pet.yml
(no credential headers in the cassette at all)
```


### 7. Re-record one cassette {#7.-Re-record-one-cassette}

```text
$ md5sum test/cassettes/store_inventory.yml
49660c906e888c670f936b47ae59737d  store_inventory.yml

$ rm test/cassettes/store_inventory.yml
$ julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
Cassettes           |   10     10  19.2s
     Testing PetstoreV2 tests passed

$ md5sum test/cassettes/store_inventory.yml
a7d8260bdd15e0e78cf6d449d2e6e62d  store_inventory.yml      # ← refreshed
```


All three runs (record / replay / re-record) exit 0 with `10/10` passing assertions.
