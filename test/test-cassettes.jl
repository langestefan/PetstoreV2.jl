# BrokenRecord lets tests record an HTTP interaction once and replay it
# deterministically afterwards.
#
# Mode is decided by file existence (no env vars):
#
#   - Cassette file does NOT exist  → recording mode: real HTTP call,
#                                     request + response saved to disk.
#   - Cassette file exists          → playback mode: response replayed,
#                                     request shape verified against the
#                                     recorded one. No network is touched.
#
# Re-record a cassette by deleting its file (or the whole directory) and
# re-running the tests once on a machine with network + valid credentials.
#
# Storage: BrokenRecord defaults to `.yml` (human-readable, diffable).
# Pass `extension="bson"` for binary BSON if cassettes get large; both
# work the same way at the call site.
#
# `path = "test/cassettes"` is a VCR-style convention; BrokenRecord's own
# docs suggest `test/fixtures` — pick whichever you prefer and update
# `mkpath` and `_run_cassette_tests` together.

# BrokenRecord at runtime via `Base.require` advances the Julia world,
# so any `BrokenRecord.*` call has to be reached via a function invocation
# (`Base.invokelatest`) — bare calls inside the same scope would fail with
# `MethodError: ... method too new to be called from this world context`.
